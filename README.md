# Î»uwecode

A purely functional language based entirely on pure [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)

## Outline:
- No special types; numbers, booleans, strings, lists, etc. are based in pure lambda calculus
- IO system is based in pure lambda calculus
- Type system is based in pure lambda calculus
- No keywords except for import directives
- Inline functions are interchangeable with prefixed calling: ``a `b c`` == `b a c`
